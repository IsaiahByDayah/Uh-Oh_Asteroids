Uh-Oh_Asteroids
===============

In class we were assigned the task of  recreating the classic Asteroids arcade  game, however we needed to add our own  spin on it. For my game I dedicated way more effort than I thought I would have and created something is is surprisingly fun and strangely addicting.   The premise of the game is that after  years of your fellow asteroids being  destroyed by the evil spaceships, you  decide to take revenge! Dodge space  lasers as you try to collide into  spaceships to destroy them. Destroy as  many as you can before you crumble to  piecesâ€¦  Feel free to download and share with your friends or dissect the code to  learn more about Processing!
