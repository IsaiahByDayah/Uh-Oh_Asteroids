**************** ABOUT ****************
***************************************

In class we were assigned the task of 
recreating the classic Asteroids arcade 
game, however we needed to add our own 
spin on it. For my game I dedicated way
more effort than I thought I would have
and created something is is surprisingly
fun and strangely addicting. 

The premise of the game is that after 
years of your fellow asteroids being 
destroyed by the evil spaceships, you 
decide to take revenge! Dodge space 
lasers as you try to collide into 
spaceships to destroy them. Destroy as 
many as you can before you crumble to 
pieces…
